This is a pet project developed during my learning journey. It's a 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent implemented using the minimax algorithm. The game is hosted at [http://tictactoe5x5.lqdlover.id.vn/](http://tictactoe5x5.lqdlover.id.vn/).

## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, enhanced to a 5x5 grid. The player competes against an AI opponent, which makes optimal moves using the minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **5x5 Grid**: Enjoy a larger game board compared to the traditional 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe.
- **AI Opponent**: Challenge yourself against a smart AI opponent that employs the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- **Responsive Design**: The web interface is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

## Usage

To play the game, simply visit [http://tictactoe5x5.lqdlover.id.vn/](http://tictactoe5x5.lqdlover.id.vn/) in your web browser and start a new game. Click on the cells to make your moves and compete against the AI opponent.
